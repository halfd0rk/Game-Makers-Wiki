# Syntax

This page is for syntax, such as bold and italics.

## Organization

This 2nd header shows different ways you can organize your syntax.

### Labeling

By labeling your syntax with clear syntax shown in the [naming-conventions](/naming-conventions).

#### camelCase
Camel case is the practice of writing phrases such that each word or abbreviation in the middle of the phrase begins with a capital letter, with no intervening spaces or punctuation.

It is also sometimes used in online usernames such as "johnSmith", and to make multi-word domain names more legible, for example in advertisements.

##### Editor's Note
This label requires the least amount of effort to use! You are pressing fewer buttons as compared to the other options. These button presses add up over time.

#### PascalCase
PascalCase is similar to CamelCase except that the first letter of every word is uppercase -- for example, MyName.

#### kebab-case
Kebab-case uses all lowercase letters and hyphens to separate words -- for example, my-name.

#### snake_case
Snake_case uses all lowercase letters and underscores to separate words -- for example, my_name.
