## Naming Conventions

| Naming Convention | Description | Example |
| :----: | :---: | :-------: |
| @      | Assets that serve as the parent to a child. Always comes before other symbols, but after any organizing words. If the parent in a preset, we usually scrap the @ and everything that follows in favor of more organized presets.     | slime.platform@1         |
