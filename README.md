## Why a wiki?

This wiki project is composed of 3 main sections:

- [Public Game Maker Knowledge](https://github.com/Drassil/git-wiki-theme): In this section we document each behavior and component found within The Sandbox Game Maker. We provide in-game uses for each and explain each input so you can better understand your games. This wiki was created to be a community driven collective knowledge base.


- [Custom Mechanics](): Here you'll find a series of unique mechanics and how one might recreate them. Wiki Collaborators will provide any links to tutorials on the relative articles.

- [Game Maker Community Changelog](https://www.sandbox.game/en/create/changelog/):\
 Our goal is to append the official changelog with any undocumented bugs and fixes we find. The original changelog can be found on the [**Sandbox Game Maker**](https://www.sandbox.game/en/create/changelog/) website.
