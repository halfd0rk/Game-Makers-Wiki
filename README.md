# Game Maker's Wiki

NOTE: it's fully supported by github platform, you don't need to install anything halfd0rk

This is a [skeleton](skeleton) repository that can be used as a template to bootstrap your wiki using "[remote_theme](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-remote-theme)" config

## Why a wiki?

This wiki project is composed of 3 main sections:

- [Public Game Maker Knowledge](https://github.com/Drassil/git-wiki-theme): In this section we document each behavior and component found within The Sandbox Game Maker. We provide in-game uses for each and explain each input so you can better understand your games. 

- [Custom Mechanics](https://github.com/Drassil/git-wiki-theme): Here you'll find a series of unique mechanics and how one might recreate them. Wiki Collaborators will provide any links to tutorials on the relative articles.

- [git-wiki-skeleton](https://github.com/Drassil/git-wiki-skeleton): This is the repo that you should fork or use as a template. It uses the [jekyll remote theme](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-remote-theme) functionality that allows you to create your own wiki based on git-wiki-theme. By using the remote functionality you can automatically keep your wiki always updated with latest features from the **git-wiki-theme**, but you can also fully customize it. 

- [Game Maker Community Changelog](https://www.sandbox.game/en/create/changelog/): Our goal is to append the official changelog with any undocumented bugs and fixes we find. The original changelog can be found on the [**Sandbox Game Maker**](https://www.sandbox.game/en/create/changelog/) website.
